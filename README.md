## Just Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate-level classes, do research, take all the hardest courses, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects, did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester, you're already behind. In fact, you should've come in with a personal project and at least 20 AP credits. Plus, you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair, they _will shoot you, they will take you out back, and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

Impostor syndrome in computer science is real. If you're not feeling it yet, [read this and you will](https://gist.github.com/kartva/30c528420d68869dbcf376cd028fe038). Even good advice does little more than provide overwhelmed students with more things they "should" be doing. This is excacerbated by student's inability to do cost-benefit analysis, meaning they struggle to integrate advice. Because these guides provide few to no methods of actually _freeing_ time (and students have few techniques to do so), most students read through a guide and are left with only the lingering anxiety that they either haven't done these things or can't possibly find the time to get around to them.

This guide will include things that you "should" do, but it largely focuses on meta-skills. These include how to learn and prioritize, the mindsets you should be approaching problems with, and more general life advice. Once you've read this guide, I hope that you'll be better able to integrate the advice you get from others.

Don't do more, make the things you're doing do more for you.

With that being said, welcome to
# An Idiot's Guide to Purdue CS
## Meta-Skills
Rather than telling you to do more extracurriculars or join more clubs, the point of this section is to teach you how to prioritize, manage time, and learn. These are meta-skills, the skills that help you learn other skills.
### Keeping Up with the Joneses
One of the most common ways I see high-achievers waste time is "Keeping Up with the Joneses". This is an idiom that refers to attempting to compete (or keep up with) the material wealth, class, or status of one's neighbors. In Purdue, it manifests as a desire to intellectually compete with those around you, to "win at Purdue" and prove yourself more intelligent, more talented, or more dedicated than your peers.

This is characterized by a desire to do things solely because you see other high-achievers doing them. A willingness to take on additional responsibility for the sole purpose of impressing your peers, or because it feels like it's what smart people do. If you read Kartava's guide and then felt like you _had_ to do many of the things he'd suggested, along with a feeling that you were "falling behind," then you're Keeping up with the Joneses. In short, you're optimizing for impressiveness towards your peers.

The Purdue rat race will drive you to put effort into things that students care a lot about, most often GPA and course load. But that's a poor strategy. The only competition at Purdue is for jobs, and standing out in the eyes of recruiters is easiest if you focus on things that recruiters care about, but most students ignore. Being stuck in the rat race means you're going to dump lots of effort into the opposite, things that students obsess over, but recruiters care very little about.

Many other things at Purdue aren't a competition, and shouldn't be treated as such. Passion projects can be solely for passion, and attempting to copy someone else's passion project, even though you don't enjoy it, will quickly make you unhappy. Joining a club because you enjoy it is great; joining a club because you feel like you have to is a bad idea.

While this is bad for the overall population of Purdue, it's good for you in the job search, because if you can manage to avoid wasting time trying to assert dominance and, say, ruthlessly optimize for employability, you might come out far ahead of people who are smarter and more dedicated than you.
### Clarify Your Goals
To avoid keeping up with the Joneses, figure out some life goals beyond just "having people think I'm smart" or "fitting in". What do you want out of college? What do you want out of life?

Ultimately, your goal should be derived from the following:

**Do things I will be glad to have done while in college.**

It's up to you to define what that means. Will your future self be glad you were studious? Probably. Will they be glad you were so studious that you never made any friends? Probably not. Find a balance.

Figuring out what you want out of life is difficult. If I had to give you a one-paragraph answer to the secret of happiness, it would be to love the process, not the product. Doing things makes you happy; having things tends not to (unless having those things allows you to do things). Having friends will make you happy; having a big house won't, unless you use that house to host friends. 

Don't ignore money, money lets you do things that'll make you happy, but don't let it get in the way of your happiness either.

Once you've thought about your broad life goals, try to break them into chunks. To me, things that I'll be glad to have done in college are:

1. Set myself up for a good future.
2. Enjoy my time at college.

I can break those goals down even further. The first goal can be broken down into:

1. Figure out which domains of CS I most enjoy.
2. Learn skills that'll help me in my future jobs.
3. Find a good job.
4. Make lifelong friends
5. Grow as a person

Keep breaking these goals down until you've got small, achievable goals that you can make concrete progress towards. It's best if these goals are somewhat short-term and have clear failure/success states.

Constantly considering the lifelong impacts of having a bagel for breakfast will drive you crazy. The simple fact of life is that most of our decisions have to be on autopilot, gut choices, or we'll go insane. Do try to put serious thought into big decisions, but don't sweat the small stuff, and don't feel pressured to exhaustively schedule everything. The most important outcome of this strategy is improving your gut sense of how important something is.

At the beginning of the week, try to have a general sense of what you've got to do and how you'll spend your time. At the end of the week, review how you spent your time, how useful that time was to achieving your goals, and how useful your smaller goals were towards their larger parent goals. Yes, actually set aside time to do this; I recommend an hour a week.

Reflection provides feedback to make your time management better. Most people only get feedback on their time management when they fail. But this also means that the vast majority of people are trapped with mediocre schedules that work, but don't work well. The only way to get better at something is feedback, and our goals provide much more specific and useful feedback than, say, a panic attack at 5 AM because you've got a midterm at 9:30 and you haven't slept in two days.

When reviewing your week, think through your actions. Ask yourself if there was a faster way to get the same result, or if there was a way to get a better result in the same amount of time. What could you have done if you'd spent the time you'd used doing X on Y instead? Would you prefer to live in that universe? Knowing what you know now, what would the ideal super-schedule for last week be?

Make sure your goals are still relevant. Both your goals and their priorities will shift constantly; check in regularly to make sure you're still spending your time efficiently. If you realize a minor won't help you, you shouldn't keep pursuing that minor.

Thinking like this will enable you to spot areas where you can get high returns on your effort, non-obvious things like clubs, personal projects, or research, rather than on the most obvious metric of success, GPA. 

If you keep asking yourself if you can do something faster, do it better, or avoid having to do it at all, you'll use your time far more efficiently. You'll also find that you're more easily able to make time for things like clubs, friends, and personal projects.
### Randomly Sample, Stick With What Works
Try to do more than you think you can in any given semester. This is where "do more" advice comes in handy; it's great at giving you more options. You should try to have as wide a spread of options as possible. Write them down, put them on a list. Pick a bunch of the things that best achieve your goals. Try to do as much as you can, then when you start getting too stressed or busy, quit until you're left with just your favorites.

The key caveat here is **not to take too much responsibility for which there are high quitting costs**. That means don't accept two TA positions until you know you can handle it, because quitting a TA position incurs a fairly high cost. 

Quitting cost is different from sunk cost. A quitting cost might be a W on your transcript. A sunk cost is the effort you put into a minor that you decided to drop. Try to minimize both.

Activities with a high quitting cost are:
- Passing courses that are prerequisites, like CS courses, in your first 3 semesters.
- TA/research positions. Quit without a good excuse and you're unlikely to be invited back.
- Leadership obligations, same as #2.
- Relationships. Self-explanatory.
- Club obligations, such as being treasurer or whatever people do in clubs.
- Classes with a group-project focus. If you take them with friends, you'll lose credibility amongst those friends.

Activities with a low quitting cost are:
- Casually attending club meetings. Go to as many club orientations as you can handle in the first bit of the semester.
- Casual friend hangouts (movie night or something), especially if you clarify that you might have to skip a few.
- Gig work.
- Personal Projects.
- Classes that aren't essential to your degree plan.
- Taking classes early to free up space (eg, taking 2 CS classes this semester instead of 1).
- Personal fitness (though this one is valuable enough that you should be wary of quitting it long-term).
- Personal grade/GPA goals, so long as you're still passing the required classes.

Be aware of the quitting costs of everything in your schedule. While you should be careful about taking too much high-quitting-cost responsibility, you should sample a large number of low-quitting-cost options.

You should try enough that you have to quit things. If you're not quitting things, you didn't sample enough. The ideal semester involves you attending a bunch of clubs, trying out a few personal projects, and then quitting the least valuable ones. By trying out a lot of things at the beginning of the semester, you'll narrow down the absolute best ways to spend your time.
### Maintain Awareness
Remember the fable of the second door. At Purdue, many large lecture halls have double doors. When people leave a class, they open one of the doors, then crowd around that single open door, waiting to go through. Multiple times, I've skipped the entire line, opened up the second door, and walked right through. There is also occasionally a second line in the dining court for identical food, much shorter than the first. There are second study spots that are quieter and less crowded than the obvious spaces, second cashiers nobody's noticed, second restaurants that are less crowded, but serve identical food.

Keep an eye out for the second door. We tend to fall into our habits too quickly, do them too unthinkingly, and miss even fairly obvious opportunities to save time or improve our lives. While college is new and fresh, we'll find our conscious mind constantly engaged as we encounter all manner of new problems. But once we've found a solution to a problem, one that works well enough, we tend to stick to it. Thoughtlessly applying it to everything that superficially resembles our original problem.

Not only does this prevent us from finding second doors, from spotting opportunities to do things faster or better, but it often freezes our skills in amber. Preventing us from using better methods or techniques, even as we're surrounded by them. Instead, we continue using our pre-made solution until it stops working, we fail, and we're shocked out of our rhythm, forced to adapt.

Instead, put effort into both reflection and planning. This can be done during the hour a week that you set aside to plan out and review your goals. Figure out how you could've been faster, done better, or gotten better performance. Realizing that you've missed a second door can help you spot the next one. When planning, keep an eye out for opportunities that have an effort-to-reward ratio skewed in your favor.

Want an example of something you're not aware of? How well/frequently you wash your hands. I'm not [kidding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E), it's a skill you probably haven't thought about since second grade, and there's a solid chance you're doing it wrong. Proper hand washing can cut your risk of infection down by quite a bit, especially considering that Purdue is a high-density collection of students from all across the country. Spending a tiny amount of time before you eat and after you've gone to the bathroom could save you days of Purflu.

Improvements and changes can be minor. They can be finding your favorite brand of pen, improving your ability to estimate how long assignments will take, learning to write professional emails, or finding a better shampoo. As long as you keep an eye out, you'll find plenty of opportunities to do things better, faster, cheaper, or more efficiently. The impact that just a little bit of awareness can have on your time here is hard to overstate.
### The Art of Giving Up
Is that hour of reflection and planning cutting into your studying? Does it feel like you can't find the time, or you're far too busy? Chances are, you're starting to get task-saturated. That's what happens when you have so much to do that you lose track of the bigger picture, too focused on the minutiae of trying to get all your work done. It kills your situational awareness, and some people will spend most of their time at college in this state.

It can feel very productive to push yourself to this state, but it's not. Not only is it terrible for your mental and physical health, but it's not even that efficient. You can't see second doors when you're task-saturated, and you're unlikely to spot opportunities for improvement.

The cure to task saturation is to quit something, to give something up, to admit that you're just too busy and that you need more time. To perfectionists, this can feel impossible; it can be very stressful to quit. Especially if that thing you're quitting might be a class that'd leave a W on your transcript. Having a concrete mark of your failure, when you're somebody used to only success, can be devastating. But refusing to quit opens you up to the possibility of a cascading failure.

The real problem with task saturation isn't just that it's suboptimal. It makes it far more difficult to reflect, plan, and take non-obvious solutions to problems. This means that perfectionists, people unused to quitting, are likely to become _less_ capable of quitting as they get more and more overwhelmed. This leads them to push themselves harder and harder. Their failures stress them out, which makes them less productive, which makes them fail more. All the while, their decision-making ability continues to worsen. In some cases, this can lead to a cascading failure.

Try to plan for the worst. Do some thinking about what you would quit and what might make you quit before you start getting stressed. Make backup plans, alternate degree progressions, and put time into thinking about what happens if you fail. In periods of high stress, it helps to have a pre-made escape route or backup plan, rather than being forced to cobble one together at the last second. Failure is never fun, but an isolated failure is far better than a cascading one that sprawls across your entire semester.

Recruiters don't tend to care if you've withdrawn from a class. Thinking through how you might fail can help you realize just how low the cost to aim extra high really is; it can let you try and do more without feeling crushed by the need to succeed. 
### Improve Yourself
Dedicate some time to improving your decision-making, goal-defining, habit-creating, or prioritizing skills. I recommend:
- Ultralearning
- Algorithms to Live By
- The Art of Clear Thinking
- Atomic Habits

When integrating advice, try to make concrete changes in your life right after you've heard it. This'll help translate advice into actual improvement.
#### Learn From Failure
Those who don't learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them. Even in situations where it feels like it wasn't your fault, you should aggressively investigate failure. I try to write post-mortems, documents in which I describe what happened, the steps I'd taken, and how I might've avoided what happened.

Don't negatively ruminate; self-criticism should be constructive. If you wouldn't tell it to your friend, don't tell it to yourself.

Don't put pressure on yourself to be perfect. It's normal to have flaws. Being aware of these flaws (most of which you'll spot when you fail) can help you avoid failures in the future. Try to slowly improve, be a little more patient, disciplined, or healthy. But recognize that you're going to be a work in progress for your whole life.
#### Beneficial Habits
Avoid [short-form content](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10756502/). Some is fine, but if you're spending longer than 30 uninterrupted minutes looking at TikTok or Instagram reels, that's a bad sign. Sending funny videos is fine, using it as a replacement for a real hobby is not.

Develop hobbies that produce something. Writing, LEGO, programming, art, cooking, amateur rocketry, pottery, or gardening. Don't try to develop the most impressive and erudite hobby. Just try to find something you enjoy doing. Not only will this help with self-actualization, but it also improves your ability to focus on projects long-term, trains you to seek happiness through production (rather than consumption or escapism), and can often be a great topic of conversation.

Try to make reading and writing hobbies, if you can. It doesn't much matter what you read (so long as it is long-form content), only that you do. Both habits encourage long-term focus, clarity of mind, and strengthen your inner monologue. Even if you read only the lowest of BookTok trash and write nothing but Scooby-Doo self-insert fanfics, you'll still end up a better communicator, more able to explain yourself in all manner of situations.

Fitness is important. Exercise improves cognitive function in both the short and long term, increases your confidence, decreases mortality, lets you move really heavy boxes, improves your mental health,  leads to better sleep, and gives you more energy. Figure out some form of exercise that you enjoy (or at least can stand) and try to do it regularly. It might take some time to get into it, and you'll feel awkward as you stumble through a workout you've not done before. But try it a few times, once you get into a rhythm, it can start feeling great. Consistency is the most important thing; pick something you can fit into your schedule.

While it's good to focus on the life you'd like to have, I recommend also thinking about the person you'd like to be. What virtues do you want to embody: kindness, conscientiousness, honesty? What principles do you want to have? What are you willing to sacrifice to be a good person? I don't expect the average person to put their life on the line for their principles, but I know people who've been unwilling to support a friend who'd been deeply hurt because it'd "cause a fuss". If your principles cannot withstand a mildly uncomfortable confrontation, then they're not principles. Plus, when you stand by your principles, you'll get an absolutely intoxicating sensation of moral superiority, and that? That's priceless.

Try to develop the skills to learn outside the classroom. If you only learn during your four years at college, you'll rapidly fall behind. Instead, put real effort into making learning a part of your daily life. This can be as simple as keeping an eye on a few news sources, or you can read the book I've recommended above, Ultralearning, and dive headfirst into the intensive methods mentioned within. What you learn matters shockingly little, only that you have the skills to learn and a habit of doing so. 
# An Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass
## This Is It. This Is All There Is.
"I'd like to have a girlfriend, but I just don't see how I'd be able to spend any time with her" - Anonymous friend with a 4.0 GPA.

It's a good idea to grind, to focus on the future, to build a better life for yourself. But don't wait to start living. Your goal isn't to be the best or to get the best job; it's to have the best life you can, and you're already living life. This is it. This is all there is. If you don't start living now, you might never start at all. If you haven't noticed, I'm trying _really hard_ to sell you on the fact that there's more to college than just academics.

Free time is not a sin, especially not if you spend it doing things you genuinely enjoy. Brainrotting on TikTok for 14 hours and skipping all your classes is a terrible idea, but forming relationships, doing fun things, and actually conversing with a member of the opposite sex (or same sex, I don't judge) aren't wastes of time if you genuinely value them. Don't put off living; don't feel guilt for living. You need balance if you're going to make it through four years here.

But on the other hand, make sure that you're actually doing things you value. It's all too easy to fall into the habit of just doing the easiest, lowest-energy activity available (Instagram Reels has taken much of my life). If you need some time to rest and relax, then you should relax, but try to do more memorable and unique things. If you can't remember what you did in your free time yesterday, you probably didn't spend it very well. Optimizing your time use doesn't apply just to academics; put effort into spending your free time doing things you're proud of having done. That being said, here's a brief **Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass at Purdue**.

### Friends
In the first few weeks, nobody has friends, so everyone wants to make friends. This time is critical; you should form as many relationships with as many people as possible, really put yourself out there. Once those few weeks end, it becomes much harder to meet people.

As school gets busier and groups become more established, people will be less open to strangers, and they'll pull back from all but their favorite people. This is when you'll figure out who your closest friends will be.

When choosing your closest friends, pick people who you'd like to become more similar to. If someone said you were a lot like your friends, and you felt happy about that, you're on the right track. Put effort into spending time with these people, even as you become more busy.

#### Talking to Strangers
- They will not remember you unless you screw up monumentally. Like, vomit in front of them or something. People do not have enough mental bandwidth to judge strangers.
- Use something you have in common. If they're strangers, then use something visible on their person ("oh wow is that a ___ shirt?"),  something in your current environment ("Does the line always get this long?"), or a shared emotion ("I bombed that exam, what about you?"). If they brush you off, don't force it, don't try again, just move on.
- Don't monologue. Most people like to talk, let them. If they're talking a lot, chances are they're enjoying the conversation. Or maybe you got a fact wrong and they're correcting you. Either way, they're engaged!

#### Making People You Talk To Friends
- Meet the same people multiple times. If you see them a lot, it makes the following steps easier.
- Try to meet outside of class or whatever environment you see them in. Walk with them, grab lunch, offer to study together.
- Try to make a routine. It's difficult to keep asking someone to hang out. It's much easier if you know you're both going to meet on Friday to study, because that's what you do every Friday.
- Be classy about rejection. If someone keeps having excuses for not hanging with you, say, "Sucks that you're so busy. Let me know when you're free," and move on.
### Roommate(s)
Ideally, with the advice above, you'll have found a group of friends. From there, you need to pick a roommate, and you'll need to do this earlier in the year than you'd think. If you plan on living off campus (try to sign a lease by October), you'll be sharing a kitchen and a lease with them. If you're on campus, then you'll be sharing a room. This can either lead to an uncomfortable cold war with what used to be a friend, or the solidification of your already rock-solid friendship bond into a friendship diamond that can transcend any mortal struggle.

Your roommate should also be someone you respect; you should want to be more like them, because after a year in the same room, you'll start to mind-meld. If your roommate is a workaholic, watching them work will encourage you. If they're a socialite, they'll help get you out of the dorm. If they're smart, they can help with classes. If they're an alcoholic... well...

A few red flags that are fine in friends but bad in roommates:
- Never leaves the room. It means they'll never leave _your_ room. If that's a problem, pick someone who touches grass more.
- Always has crazy stuff happen to them. If you're their friend, you get a front row seat. If you're their roommate, you might become involved in their drama.
- Is a little too crazy/fun. Remember, this person is going to be in your room, in your space. Make sure you can relax around them.
- Always in fights. They'll start fighting with you.
- Is a romantic interest. Don't, not until you've known them for longer than a few months.
- Is someone who constantly needs help or is struggling. You're likely to get wrapped up in their problems.

Coincidentally, these apply to romantic partners too.
### Romance
Most romantic advice is bad. I'll keep this short so I don't add to it.

You cannot make people like you. If someone doesn't seem to like you, move on. Don't follow them around, don't ask them out for the seventh time, don't harass them, don't complain about them. It doesn't matter if you feel like this is once-in-a-lifetime love; if they're not feeling it, there's not much you can do. Meeting lots of people is a far better strategy for finding someone who likes you than obsessing over your one female friend.

You cannot change people. If someone is a mess when you meet them, they're likely to stay a mess when you date them. If they're depressed when you meet them, they'll be depressed when you date them. Especially do not date people because you feel sorry for them, or because you think you can help them. If you want to help someone, it's best to do that as their friend, not as their partner.

Once you're in a relationship, things that work for some people won't work for others. Ultra-generic relationship advice tends not to work. Figure out what your partner likes (you can ask them) and do that. If you're not sure how they're feeling about something, ask them. Do your best not to push them into anything they're uncomfortable with, and avoid moving the relationship quicker than they'd like. For some people, a proposal six months into a relationship is amazing; for others, it's a nightmare. It all depends on your partner.

Don't date the first person you lay eyes on in BGR.
# The Academics
### My Study Methods
Classes often contain three things you need to study:
1. Procedural knowledge. How to do something. Like math.
2. Conceptual knowledge. What something is, does, or how it works. Like history.
3. Factual knowledge. Dates, names, numbers, definitions. Also like history.

Study for the test you'll be given. Even if a class contains lots of factual knowledge, don't study it unless it's on the test. Of course, if information interests you for its own sake, feel free to study it as much as you'd like.

Study procedural knowledge by performing the procedures you'll be tested on as often as possible, in as similar an environment to the test as possible. That means do study guides, write practice code problems for 240, 250, and 252, and do them repeatedly. Grade your work; if you did it wrong, redo it correctly. Most students will come in with only a conceptual, theoretical understanding. Practicing the procedure will make you far faster and much more correct.

Study conceptual knowledge by picking topics and trying to write your entire understanding of them down as quickly as possible. Don't use the internet or outside help. After you're done, use your resources to edit your initial writing to make it better. Learning about paging? Write everything you know about paging down on a sheet of paper (or an online document), then go to the slides to add all the facts you missed.

Study factual knowledge with flashcards. Add mnemonics, songs, or chants if you have difficulty remembering something. Like using the movie title GATTACA to remember the four nucleotide bases.

Use spaced repetition. Just because you have a good grasp of something now doesn't mean you'll still remember it for the test. The more times you review something, the more likely it is to stay in your brain.

Remember that classes can involve multiple different types of knowledge, and that you'll often be assessed on being able to complete a certain procedure (correctly answering test questions). While you may know everything about CS-252, it can be worthwhile to practice writing code in the style of the exam, on a piece of paper, with no IDE, because that's what you'll be tested on.

Do not mindlessly re-read notes except as a quick refresher before an exam. If you're not rephrasing it, remembering it, or learning it for the first time, you're probably not learning at all.
### Use TAs
I'm biased, obviously, but we do occasionally know what we're talking about. If you're stuck on something, you could spend three hours figuring it out. Or you could show up to office hours (or another lab session), ask a TA, and watch them solve it in five minutes.

Please at least attempt to solve it beforehand. Try to add print statements and give the TAs information about what you've tried and what hasn't worked. It'll help us fix your issue far faster than if you just plop a computer down in front of us and go, "It doesn't work". TAs are essential in CS250 and CS252 (what a coincidence... the classes I TA).

Ask undergraduate TAs for advice in the class. They've taken the class before and did well enough that they were able to TA it. Graduate TAs are a great source of advice if you want to go into grad school. If the lab is slow, don't be afraid to ask them about their research, their path to grad school, and their life advice. Remember that their priority is answering lab-related questions; don't bother them when they're busy!
### Academic Dishonesty
Most often, cheating is done out of desperation due to poor time management, which means it's done sloppily. Sloppy cheating is never the best use of your time; it is never optimal. It's more of a signal that you've got too much on your plate, or that you lack time management skills. Every semester, we tell people in CS-180 that they'll get caught if they copy-paste someone else's work. Every semester, a horde of idiots does just that. Rather than cheating, I recommend the tactics I mention in **Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)**.

When talking about the risks of cheating, most obviously, you could get caught. Purdue will not mess around, and you probably can't BS them once they're on to you. I know people who run academic integrity for the courses you'll probably be taking. It's difficult to tell who's using ChatGPT, but we've had decades of experience catching students who copy and paste. If you do cheat, there's an automatic 0 on the assignment (duh). You're also likely to get your overall letter grade lowered (eg, if you would have gotten an A, you get a B+ or a B) and could end up with your cheating recorded by the Office of the Dean of Students.

Another risk is that you don't learn the class content. That's not too bad if it's some random class you're taking to meet an arbitrary graduation requirement. That's disastrous if you're taking any of the following classes:
1. CS-180
2. CS-182
3. CS-240
4. CS-250
5. CS-251, if you plan on doing anything related to algorithms (eg, CS-381)
6. CS-252, if you plan on doing anything related to systems (eg, CS-354)
7. Calc 1 and Calc 2

Failing to understand the concepts presented in these classes will directly impact your performance in later classes. Even within a single class, failing to understand prerequisite material can result in needing to cheat later on to maintain your performance.

If you have a history of cheating in Calc-1 and then attempt to cheat your way through Calc-2 and get caught, you'll either have to risk further penalty by continuing to cheat or teach yourself all the concepts you missed in Calc-1 so you can complete the course authentically.

Never, ever cheat in CS-180. Not only do you run the risk of getting a permanent mark on your record for cheating in the easiest CS class in your easiest semester, but you run the risk of never learning core skills that you'll use for the rest of your degree (and career). 

If you cheat, that is a strong sign that you struggle with time management, motivation, or some other core competency, which almost guarantees your failure. Fix it before classes get harder. 

CS-180 is a course that teaches you to program by forcing you to do a lot of programming. It may feel fairly repetitive, but the repetition will increase your speed, decrease the quantity of bugs you produce, and make the entire rest of college easier. Not to mention your first semester is crucial to building good habits that'll stick with you for the rest of college. 

If you're seriously considering frequent cheating in CS-180, I'd advise dropping out or changing majors. The only scenario in which I could see that kind of cheating in CS-180 being a good idea is if those options weren't available to you (unsafe home environment and parents who would only pay for a CS degree, for example). 

Other than that, cheating in CS-180 is monumentally stupid. You're cheating during the tutorial. This is as easy as it gets. If you don't learn now, you'll have to learn later, in a far less forgiving course.

In general, I'd say it's okay to:
1. Check answers with friends.
2. Describe and clarify the requirements of a problem (eg, clarifying a bad handout or something).
3. Describe how you solved a problem in English.
4. Solve a problem/algorithm in English together, then go off and write your own code.

You start getting into cheating territory when you:
1. Edit someone else's code directly.
2. Tell someone the exact code you used.
3. Copy-paste. Don't copy-paste. You'll get caught, and it's stupid. Don't.
### Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)
You don't need to learn everything in every class at college. Most of the classes are pretty useful; that communications class is more valuable than you'd think. But oftentimes, random gen-eds and classes in areas that don't interest you are going to be chock full of stuff you don't care about. In those courses, your goal should be to get a good grade or the credits you need with minimal effort.

If you aren't interested in a course, try to see if you can get away with not taking it. Use CLEP credits, a test-out, or try to swap the class with a class you're interested in.

If that doesn't work, try to see if there are online variants of the class, easier professors, or professors who are known for not taking attendance. 

Now it's worth clarifying that you are human, and your judgment is flawed. You could catastrophically misjudge a course (or its difficulty), decide that some topic is useless before realizing it's going to keep cropping up over and over again (cough concurrency cough), or fail to understand how a course might not help your academic understanding of computer science, but could be pretty useful in a job or your personal life. Putting minimal effort in comes with risks (especially when done with CS courses), make sure those risks are worth it.

If you want to understand the topics in a course:
- Follow along with it as it's taught; don't learn the concepts right before the exam.
- Attend class.
- Review what you learned in class afterwards.
- Review frequently, even if only for a small amount of time.
- Rephrase the knowledge, try to distill key concepts, write out everything you know about the subject, and talk about it to your friends.

My strategy to get a good grade in a low-effort class is:
- Skip classes if you can learn on your own faster.
- Do as much homework as early as possible in the semester so it's out of the way.
- Ignore class content until you get near an exam, then cram for the exam.

It's very risky to use my ignore-then-cram strategy. Until you're used to college, it's not worth it. For many people, it may never be worth it. Additionally, like I said, our judgment is flawed. Extreme time-saving measures early on in college can hurt your grades or prevent you from learning things you really should've learned. Start slow, be careful.

STAT-511 was, to me, a course I didn't care much about. The concepts were easy enough to review on their own, most of which I'd already learned in AP Stats. I'd show up to class (attendance was required), put my earbuds in, and do other work. I'd blitz through the homework, looking to complete it with minimal effort, then right before the exam, I studied a bit. I got a 100%. 

Then I studied the same for the final, which ended up being an entirely different format from the first exam. My overall grade in this fairly easy course was reduced to a B+. If I'd had a better understanding of the course, I could've gotten an A. This can happen to you if you cruise through a class with minimal effort. 

In a perfect world, we could invest a ton of effort into every class we took, but at Purdue, you're going to be busy. If you're forced to make time or are fighting with a stuffed schedule, putting less effort into classes that you deem less important can be a good idea.
### White Whales
White Whales are classes that are fairly easy to get a B or C in, but require an extreme amount of effort to get an A. Perfectionists will often tank their mental health, putting all their other graders (and activities) at risk, to chase a White Whale. This is a particularly bad idea if the course is one you're not interested in, passionate about, or suited for.

If you think it's achievable, then feel free to hunt that White Whale. But remember that your effort should be used in the most efficient manner possible. If the time spent getting an A could've been used to make a stellar personal project, was the A worth it?

It's also worth noting that you could be dumping a lot of effort into a strategy that's just not working. What might at first seem to be a white whale could be an easy A once you learn how to study for it. Ask successful friends (or strangers) how they studied.
### Beware the Rogue Wave
No individual class is all that hard. They're not designed to be hard; they're designed to teach you things. That sometimes means lots of work, or some difficult exams, but classes are scheduled so that they're not overwhelming. 

The real problem is that you don't just have one class, you've got five. While a single class will attempt to distribute its work evenly so as not to overwhelm students, multiple classes can and _absolutely will_ synchronize midterms, projects, or homeworks to all be due at once.

I once had an incredibly easy semester, except for when every single one of my classes had a midterm over the space of 6 days. Just like how waves can combine to create massive rogue waves, your classes will combine to create rogue waves of work that will sweep you away unless you spot them ahead of time.

Part of the reason it's so important to avoid task saturation is that workloads will vary massively, and in ways you can't predict. If you're too task-saturated, you might not spot a rogue wave until it's on top of you.

Read the syllabus, make sure you're aware of when midterms will happen, and try to lessen their impact.
### Beware Credentialism
By my nature, I'm overly credentialist; I like having stamps, symbols, and little gold stars that say I'm smart. But most recruiters won't care all that much; your third CS track might be doing little more than providing you the illusion of productivity.

Often, your resume is only required to get you past HR, who will have only a tenuous understanding of what each item on it means. They're mostly looking to tick boxes; there's no meaningful difference between a qualified candidate and an _extremely_ qualified candidate. From there, your resume will be presented to a manager making a hiring decision, and their interest in it varies widely. My manager this summer said he looks at resumes for "all of two seconds". Unless you can clearly explain how a course you took will help you do your job, it's probably not going to help. If nobody cares, why take a class? Audit instead.

While yes, additional classes or minors might help you find a job, they often have high sunk costs; half a minor is worth even less than a whole one. You should not throw them in your schedule without thought, do difficult classes "just because you can", or take them because you're smart, and smart people take hard classes. Rather than doing impressive extracurriculars, I often see intelligent people dump their time into dubiously rewarding second majors, difficult classes that lack clear benefit, or crushing schedules done only for bragging rights.

You should take an additional class, major, minor, or track if:
- It is the most efficient way to increase your employability, or the quantity and quality of employment options.
- You require the credential that having a good grade in the class provides.
- The class is the most efficient way of learning a topic.
- The benefit of having the class on your transcript is worth the significant increase in quitting costs over auditing a course
- You enjoy the class as a hobby, and even if it didn't help you at all, you still would've been glad to have taken it
- You require the accountability of a class to learn.
- You require direct feedback on your work (which large classes rarely provide).

If you want to learn about cloud computing, should you take a class, or should you email a dozen people employed in cloud computing roles, asking for their perspective? If you want to gain experience working on software projects, should you take a class like 307, or avoid the class and start a project with your friends? Consider alternative ways of learning the same content.

If you have extra time, only increase your class load if it's genuinely the best use of your time. Don't do so thoughtlessly. This comes with the caveat that some people lack motivation and must put themselves in situations with high accountability/quitting costs to get anything done. If this describes you, then the high quitting costs of classes might be a necessary evil to learn, and you should take additional classses.

If you wish to broaden your horizons, learn for learning's sake, or gain additional experience, consider:
- Auditing a course.
- Attending a club.
- Doing project-based learning.
- Asking a professor to do research in that area.
- Making use of online resources, like MIT's free courses.
- Doing a Co-op.
- Contributing to open-source projects.
- Conversing with domain experts (professors, people employed in the field).

These are especially useful if you're skilled at teaching yourself, tend to outpace curricula, find classwork meaningless and repetitive, or have difficulty learning via lectures.

Respect the time investment that comes with adding a course, track, major, or minor. Don't add them thoughtlessly.
## The Job Hunt
While academics dominate the minds of students, the hunt for internships (and jobs) is what's important. Not so much your freshman year (though you should turn up to a few career fairs to get used to it), but sophomore year and up, your internships can matter as much as (or more than) your grades.

Despite this, students tend to massively underinvest in finding an internship. This makes it comparatively easy to stand out in the job search (far easier than standing out in terms of GPA). 

If you were willing to get Bs in a few hard classes instead of As (or Cs instead of Bs), it might lower your GPA by 0.1 or 0.2. Dedicating that time to aggressively hunting for jobs, tuning up your resume, getting a professional headshot taken, and practicing interview skills can set you apart from the crowd.

In your freshman year, spend time asking people at career fairs what they look for on resumes, getting advice from upperclassmen, and making use of the many Purdue resources to help you get a job. Practice mock interviews, learn STAR questions, and you'll do great.
### Career Fairs
A few hours at a career fair can save you dozens of hours applying to online positions. Go to booths that have people actively interviewing, not just advertising. If they have iPads, take resumes, or have some software component where you register your attendance at the career fair, those are the most valuable booths. If not, there's a chance you'll just be told to apply online, and nothing you said to the recruiter will impact your chances of an offer.

Do research beforehand, and create a list of companies you want to talk to. Check that they accept people of your class level. Prioritize those that seem to be doing interviews (as mentioned), Google them in-depth while you're in line. Come off as curious, open to learn, but knowledgeable. Don't try to outsmart the recruiter; be friendly, emphasize passion, experience, and anything unique that helps you stand out.

I've found that "talking shop" with a recruiter (discussing both of your experiences in technical projects, classes, etc) tends to be a great way to get them to like you. Bring up your relevant experiences whenever possible.
### Resume
Spend time on your resume. For a few hours of investment, you can see massive improvements in the kinds of opportunities you'll get and how successful you are at applying. I don't know how to write a good resume, but other people do; you should seek their feedback constantly.

There are resume workshops, Purdue-sponsored resume tools, and plenty more to help you tune up your resume. Don't treat your resume as a hobby or your last priority; put real effort into it.
### Applying Online
Cover letters should be short, if you write them at all. They should be of the format "Hey, I'm __ from Purdue University, I think my skills in X and Y, and my project Z would make me a good fit for this position." Don't use ChatGPT, don't glaze the company, just explain why you're a good fit for that position.

Apply early, apply to far more companies than you think you should. Aim for over 100 applications. Start applying almost as soon as school starts. This is less relevant in your freshman year. If you want a freshman internship, consider having rich parents with valuable industry connections.

Feel free to use tools that will automate filling out Workday forms. I used Simplicity, but it ran into some issues. I'm going to try to build an automated tool that'll rapidly fill out applications. I'll link it here if/when I finish it.
### A Short Note
Frankly, I was pretty bad at hunting for jobs. Seek advice from recruiters, your interviewers, upperclassmen, and people working in the CCO. I didn't put much effort into hunting for a job two years ago, and last year I stumbled into an opportunity so quickly that I didn't have much time to learn the ins and outs of job hunting.

The advice of other people would be much appreciated. If you've had success, what helped you? What was a standout on your resume that didn't take much time to do? What kind of things are people sleeping on? What should they do more of?
### Doing the Job
If you've got an internship, you should treat it as a combination behavioral interview and learning opportunity. You've already gotten the internship, so they're likely confident in your technical skills. Your return offer will rely on your ability to cooperate with others, communicate, and produce quality work.
#### Ask the Right Kinds of Questions
What are the right kinds of questions? They're questions that can't be answered on your own and rely on the experience of your boss. Don't ask questions you can Google, don't ask questions that are answered in the onboarding resources you've been given. 

Feel more than free to ask questions to clarify your boss's instructions, get their help on a problem, get advice about the corporate world (or about life), or double-check something important that you're unsure about.

Many people make the mistake of treating an internship like they're interviewing. That's sort of correct, but remember that internships are more about cultural fit than technical competency. It's okay (expected even) to admit you don't know something, but it's very annoying to pretend that you do, then fail. Don't pretend you know things that you don't.

If you _do_ pretend you know things that you don't, then absolutely don't keep pretending even after it's obvious you're clueless. Do not double down; your boss can tell when you're doubling down on your ignorance, and it frustrates them. It also makes it less likely they'll take time out of their day to explain things to you, because explaining things to someone who refuses to admit they're lost is incredibly frustrating.
#### Do Your Work
Self-explanatory, yet difficult for some people to grasp.
#### Yes, That Means You Should Be Doing Your Work, Not AI
If your manager is okay with you using an LLM, that's great! But use it as a tool, double-check its output, and understand what it's doing.

Otherwise, you run the risk of generating bad work, missing out on a great deal of learning opportunities, and being unable to answer basic questions about what you've done.
#### Know the Warning Signs
The corporate world tends to be incredibly sanitized. When you screw up (especially as an intern), people won't get mad at you, they won't yell at you, they might not even say "you screwed up". They will smile at you because that's their job, then they will tell the people making hiring decisions that you're a terrible fit.

Some red flags are:
- People start doing work that was once assigned to you, even though you're not busy.
- Your manager has a habit of sighing really hard in meetings when you present your work.
- People often need to redo the work you've done. They don't just offer feedback; they make you step-by-step change it in front of them, or they take it from you and fix it.
- In meetings, people say things like "why don't we discuss the disconnect" or "this really needs to get done"
- You're micromanaged significantly more than the other interns

Remember, the corporate world is very, very nice (at least at the surface level). If people say "oh, we do X here," that's not a fun fact; they're telling you to do X. If they tell you "oh, we don't generally do Y," they're telling you not to do Y. If they say "you shouldn't" or "try not to," that's not a request, that's an order. Better to be over-sensitive to this stuff than to miss it and piss people off.
#### Network
Go out of your way to talk to a bunch of people. You're like the office kids; everyone likes it when you come around to visit. Try not to overdo it, though, and be respectful of important people's time. You should only have friendly/introductory meetings once; if you meet again, it should be because they offered, or you have a work-related question for them.

If you schedule a friendly meeting with someone, mention why you're interested in them specifically, something from their background that sets them apart, or your interest in the position they occupy. Oftentimes, you can leave a positive impression (and pick up some wisdom) by just asking a few questions and letting people monologue.

Also, try to remember the names of the people you run into day-to-day. This can be as simple as dedicating 15 minutes to studying a list of them that you've written down.
## Conclusion
I'd like to think I'm a good writer, and good writing can fool you into thinking what I say is more official, more authoritative, or more trustworthy than it is. Perhaps if I add additional perspectives to this document, get validation from professors and advisors, and revise this document two or three (hundred) times, it'll become trustworthy. As of now, you should treat this as a particularly long comment on social media.

This document, long as it is, represents only one perspective. I did my best to communicate the most valuable things I've learned, but I am just one person. 

This isn't a bible; it shouldn't be treated as such. It should be treated as one piece of advice, from one person, that you may use as you wish. Gather additional advice from your academic advisor, your peers, your upperclassmen, your professors, and random strangers on Reddit when you inevitably post something like "How hard is CS240?".  

The most important things I've mentioned are:
- Figure out what you want out of life, and take steps to achieve that.
- Try a lot, then pare down your responsibilities until you can manage it.
- Keep an eye out for new opportunities.
- Put effort into becoming a good person.
- Don't wait to start living, enjoy college.
- Be incredibly chatty in your first few weeks here.
- Spend more time than you think you should hunting for jobs.
- When you've got a job, remember that people will be very nice to you, but that doesn't mean they're not upset at you.

The absolute most important takeaway is to never stop learning, growing, and improving. Don't get stuck in your ways; keep looking for ways to do better.
#### Feedback
If you've spotted anything that looks like bad advice, please tell me so I can fix it (you can open an issue on the repo). The same goes for grammatical errors. The first draft I threw in Grammarly had over 600; I'm used to them. If you've got advice to give, leave it below. I'll do my best to credit you. Reading through this whole thing isn't easy, and I respect the commitment to get to the end. Because of that, your comments, critiques, or additional advice to add is incredibly valuable. I'll try to respond to all of it.
