## Just Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate-level classes, do research, take all the hardest courses, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects, did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester, you're already behind. In fact, you should've come in with a personal project, and at least 20 AP credits. Plus, you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair, they _will shoot you, they will take you out back, and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good-for-nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

Impostor syndrome in computer science is real. If you're not feeling it yet, look up "Purdue CS guide" and you will. Too much advice does little more than provide overwhelmed students with more things they "should" be doing. People also often fail to give a cost-benefit analysis, instead assuming that the reader has infinite time to dedicate to whatever activity catches their eye. Because these guides provide few to no methods of actually _freeing_ or better managing time, most students read through a guide and are left with only the lingering anxiety that they either haven't done these things or can't possibly find the time to get around to them.

Instead, this guide will attempt to focus on teaching you how to select, from your varied and overwhelming options, the best ways to spend your time, along with broader life advice. In this guide, there will be traditional advice, things you _should_ do, but I'll do my best to keep these short and limited. Instead, my goal is that, having read this guide, you can independently seek out and integrate advice into your life without getting overwhelmed or feeling inadequate.

Don't do more, make the things you're doing do more for you.

With that being said, welcome to
# An Idiot's Guide to Purdue CS
## Life Skills
The meat of this guide won't be academic advice; it'll be broad life skills and mindsets that'll help you spend your time more efficiently. Rather than telling you to do more extracurriculars or join more clubs, the point of this section is to help you figure out which activities are most valuable and how much time you should spend on them.
### Playing a Role
As I was getting ready for my final round interview, I turned to my roommate, laughed, and said, "Y'know this interview will probably do more for my future than any individual class this semester". Then it sank in. This interview was more important than any of my classes _what the hell had I been doing?_ I was walking into the interview with almost no preparation. I'd never devoted time to "studying" interview skills, and I'd treated applying for internships like a hobby even though it was the single most important task of the semester.

I'd made the mistake of playing a role. That role was "Responsible Student". I played it because it was easy, and it made me feel responsible and intelligent. I was fretting over my grades because that's what a Responsible Student does. I was constantly studying because that's what a Responsible Student does. I hadn't put enough effort into my internship hunt because a Responsible Student only cares about their GPA, and internships come distant second in terms of priority.

Roles are what happen when you're working to achieve goals that are irrelevant to your deeper desires, following habits that are long past their usefulness, or stuck in a rut. They're characterized by a general lack of understanding of how any particular action will help you get what you want out of life, a feeling that you're doing things "because they're what you're supposed to do", and an inability to properly prioritize tasks.

Don't fall into a role. Don't take the harder version of a class you don't care about because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't overstudy to get an A+ in every class because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't devote your entire life to academics because it's what Responsible Students do. It's tempting to just pick the role of Responsible Student and trust that everything will work out. It's tempting to think that by being a responsible enough student, you'll get good internships and a good job. It's also not true.

Roles prevent the use of tools and activities that would otherwise be useful. They prevent you from taking advantage of non-standard opportunities and tend to lead to tunnel-visioning on your classes and GPA. Accepting a lower grade because it's not a good use of your time, withdrawing from a class that is more difficult this semester than the next, these are not the actions of a Responsible Student, but for you, they might be optimal. Maybe taking the easy way out _is_ the responsible thing to do?

Other roles include:
- The Cool Guy who does things just to fit in and feel popular.
-  The Genius who must always succeed, so he never tries anything that he might fail at.
- The Good Person who always puts other people first, even if they're hurting her.
-  The Next Steve Jobs, who regards things like entry-level jobs as beneath him and must always feel special.
- The Expert who must always be the most knowledgeable about everything and cannot learn from her peers.
- The Resume Maxxer who only does things if they'll appear on his resume.
- The Robot, which unthinkingly does all work placed in front of it with no regard to its goals.
- The Best, who is constantly competing with the people around them.

We often fall into roles because we haven't spent enough time thinking about our goals and what we want out of life. If you do something, do it because it'll help you achieve your goals. If an A+ won't matter to recruiters and your goal is to get a job, then an A+ should always be a pleasant surprise, but never something you shoot for. Fall into a role and you're likely to spend your valuable time _extremely_ inefficiently, learn less than you otherwise could've, and miss out on a plethora of opportunities.
### Clarify Your Goals
To avoid falling into a role, try to figure out the goals you're trying to achieve. What do you want out of college? What do you want out of life?

Ultimately, your goal should be derived from the following:

**Do things I will be glad to have done while in college.**

It's up to you to define what that means. Will your future self be glad you were studious? Probably. Will they be happy that you make lifelong friendships? Probably. Will they be glad you didn't leave your room for 18 days to get an A in some random course that never mattered? Probably not. Will they be glad you went on a 3 AM bender and got a DUI? Unlikely.

Figuring out what you want out of life is difficult. If I had to give you a one-paragraph answer to the secret of happiness, it would be to love the process, not the product. Processes make us happy, the products of those processes [do not](https://youtu.be/TbwlC2B-BIg?si=MHjXcu_QqXWW_KVu&t=71). The hedonistic treadmill means that the vast majority of material goods end up being briefly nice, then fade into the background and become our new baseline normal. Don't focus on one-off achievements; focus on filling your day with satisfying work, meaningful hobbies, and people that make you happy. These are all made easier by having lots of money, but money isn't an end in and of itself, unless chasing it makes you happy. I like chasing achievement, but I don't think to myself "boy, I'll finally be happy when I've done X". I'm happy while I'm working towards things, then for a bit I'm extra happy when I achieve them. But that extra happiness fades, and then I set my sights on the next goal. When this guide is done, I'm going to be very happy that I finished it. Then, ten minutes later, I'll get bored and start the next thing. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

Once you've thought about your broad life goals, try to break them into chunks. To me, things that I'll be glad to have done in college are:

1. Set myself up for a good future.
2. Enjoy my time at college.

I can break those goals down even further. The first goal can be broken down into:

1. Figure out which domains of CS I most enjoy.
2. Learn skills that'll help me in my future jobs.
3. Find a good job.
4. Make lifelong friends
5. Grow as a person

Keep breaking these goals down until you've got small, achievable goals that you can make concrete progress towards. It's best if these goals are somewhat short-term and have clear failure/success states.

If you've got to think about your goals every time you do something, you're going to give yourself an aneurysm. That's way too much mental overhead to be involved in your day-to-day life. If you've got a big decision or some massive opportunity, it might be worth running through your goals and consciously thinking things through. But most of our days should be filled with doing, not planning or considering. Instead, at the beginning of the week, try to set a few goals and broadly sketch out how you're going to spend your time. The point of all this is to use your goals as a rubric, a way of grading how good your week was.

Constantly considering the lifelong impacts of having a bagel for breakfast will drive you crazy. The simple fact of life is that most of our decisions have to be on autopilot, gut choices, or we'll go insane. Do try to put serious thought into big decisions, but don't sweat the small stuff, and don't feel pressured to exhaustively schedule everything.


At the beginning of the week, try to have a general sense of what you've got to do and how you'll spend your time. At the end of the week, review how you spent your time, how useful that time was to achieving your goals, and how useful your smaller goals were towards their larger parent goals.

This provides feedback to make your instinctual time management better. Most people only get feedback on their time management when they fail. But this also means that the vast majority of people are trapped with mediocre schedules that work, but don't work well. The only way to get better at something is feedback, and our goals provide much more specific and useful feedback than, say, a panic attack at 5 AM because you've got a midterm at 9:30 and you haven't slept in two days.

When reviewing your week, think through your actions and ask yourself if there was a faster way to get the same result, or if there was a way to get a better result in the same amount of time. What could you have done if you'd spent the time you'd used doing X on Y instead? Would you prefer to live in that universe? Knowing what you know now, what would the ideal super-schedule for last week be? Think through your goals and ensure that they're still relevant. Both your goals and their priorities will shift constantly; you need to check in somewhat regularly to make sure you're still spending your time efficiently.

Did you hear that your GPA doesn't matter as much as your research when getting into grad school? That's a sign that you should put more effort into your "do research" goal and less into your "get a high GPA" goal. Did you find out that there's an option to use CLEP credit for a class you're taking right now? If it's early enough in the semester, withdraw from the course and test out instead. Remember that goals should exist only to serve their parent goals. If I have the parent goal "finish my gen-eds," then a child goal of "test out of X" is superior to the goal "get an A in X". But unless we go through and clean up our goals, we might end up following old, stale goals that are long past their usefulness. That's how we fall into roles.

Thinking like this will enable you to spend more time on non-obvious things like clubs, personal projects, or research rather than on the most obvious metric of success, GPA. 

Because GPA is so obvious, it's difficult to stand out. Most students dump the vast majority of their time into their GPA, even when it's not optimal. If it takes you ~6 hours a week to bump your grade up from a B to an A in a single class, what else could you be doing with that time? Is there something you could put on your resume that'd be more impressive than the GPA increase from that class? Often, the answer is yes. Spend 40 hours a week in classes and you'll have an okay GPA. Spend 10 hours a week on personal projects, and you'll have some stellar projects.

If you keep asking yourself if you can do something faster, do it better, or avoid having to do it at all, you'll use your time far more efficiently. You'll also find that you're more easily able to make time for things like clubs, friends, and personal projects.
### Aim Big, Cut Aggressively
Try to do more than you think you can in any given semester. This is where "do more" advice comes in handy; it's great at giving you more options. You should try to have as wide a spread of options as possible. Write them down, put them on a list. Pick a bunch of the things that best achieve your goals. Try them out, then cut responsibility if (when) you start getting too stressed. 

The key caveat here is **not to take too much responsibility for which there are high quitting costs**. That means don't accept two TA positions until you know you can handle it, because quitting a TA position incurs a fairly high cost. Quitting cost comes in two forms: the immediate cost (like the cost to quit a gym membership) and sunk cost (like the time you lose throwing away a puzzle you've half completed). Try to minimize sunk cost (eg, by taking classes that can be reused if you quit a minor), but don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. It can feel terrible to give up when you're a class away from a minor, but if that minor isn't worth the class, quit. On the other hand, immediate quitting costs are very bad. If you're quitting things with significant immediate costs, then you've planned poorly.

Activities with a high quitting cost are:
- Passing courses that are prerequisites, like CS courses, in your first 3 semesters.
- TA/research positions. Quit without a good excuse and you're unlikely to be invited back.
- Leadership obligations, same as #2.
- Relationships. Self-explanatory.
- Club obligations, such as being treasurer or whatever people do in clubs.
- Classes with a group-project focus. If you take them with friends, you'll lose credibility amongst those friends.
- Other majors, if you can't reuse the classes you took for them.

Activities with a low quitting cost are:
- Casually attending club meetings. Go to as many club orientations as you can handle in the first bit of the semester.
- Casual friend hangouts (movie night or something), especially if you clarify that you might have to skip a few.
- Gig work.
- Personal Projects.
- Classes that aren't essential to your degree plan.
- Taking classes early to free up space (eg, taking 2 CS classes this semester instead of 1).
- Other majors, if you can reuse the classes you took for them.
- Personal fitness (though this one is valuable enough that you should be wary of quitting it long-term).
- Personal grade/GPA goals, so long as you're still passing the required classes.

Be aware of the quitting costs of everything in your schedule. Feel free to massively scale up your low-cost responsibilities. Start personal projects, show up to every club that's even slightly interesting, take classes for fun, and try to speed up your progression through your degree (as long as you can withdraw with little/no cost if you start getting overwhelmed). But be very careful in scaling up high-cost responsibilities. Try to avoid having more high-cost responsibilities than you had total responsibility last semester.

You should do enough that you have to quit things, fill your schedule with fun and useful activities that have low quitting costs. If you're not quitting things, you're not doing enough. This means the ideal semester looks like you attending a bunch of clubs, trying out a few personal projects, and then quitting the least valuable ones. By trying out a lot of things at the beginning of the semester, you'll narrow down the absolute best ways to spend your time, and then you can quit what isn't valuable to you.

The most important part of this is gracefully shedding responsibility to bring yourself into balance. Your goal is not to do **as much as possible**, it is to achieve your goals. Your goals are best achieved with a calm, clear mind that has sufficient rest. Don't wait to feel the negative consequences of your responsibilities. Especially do not fall into the role of The Best, because The Best never fails, The Best must succeed in everything he does, and he will die trying. Remember that it is not failure to shed responsibilities to give yourself more time to rest or to guarantee better performance on more important activities. It's a key part of the process. More on this in **Maintain Awareness**.

It's really worth emphasizing this point; even incredibly talented people can be brought low by their intense schedules. It's the most common way I see ambitious and intelligent people fail. People who could've accepted one or two Ws on their transcript in exchange for a manageable semester instead find their entire schedule collapsing as they flicker between burning out and panicking to try to get work done, assignments slip past their notice, and a feeling of overwhelming failure mounts. This can cause people who've never properly dealt with failure to utterly collapse; it's why your advisor will heavily advise against difficult course loads.

Gracefully quitting things, admitting when work is getting too much, taking too long, and coming too fast before it all mounts into irreversible crises are essential skills to have in college. Not only do they prevent a cascading failure, but they enable you to take bigger risks, do more, and push harder.
### Maintain Awareness
Imagine you're hiking to a place you've never been with nothing but a map. Getting to your destination is a combination of walking and checking the map. You can't do both at the same time. If you spend all day checking the map (planning, considering possibilities, setting goals), you'll never go anywhere. If you never check the map, you'll end up 14 miles deep in bear country. On straight, simple paths (finals week), it might be worth it to put your head down and walk. But if the path is full of splits and forks, it's worth checking the map more often. No balance works for everyone all the time, but everyone needs a balance.

Always keep a little bit left in the tank, always save some effort for checking the map. This helps your mental health and lets you spot opportunities you might've otherwise missed. If, instead, you put in maximal effort all the time, you'll end up being _task saturated_. When you're task saturated, you're so busy doing stuff that you have no time to think about, reflect on, or reprioritize the stuff you're doing. You end up being locked in a basic algorithm where you go from one task to the next. Your goals become stale, then rot. You become less efficient, you stop learning, you stop seeking out new opportunities. You're walking without knowing which direction you're headed. This is the hidden cost of having a semester that's too busy.

It's okay for this to happen in the short term, the very short term, for instance, right before an exam or during the week before finals. Sometimes it's do or die. But task saturation is utterly disastrous in the long term. It's terrible for your mental health, it increases the amount of errors your work has, makes it more likely some crucial responsibility will pass by unnoticed, decreases your cognitive performance, and forces you into the role of The Robot. The Robot is a terrible role to play. You'll lose most executive function, which can include your ability to gracefully quit responsibilities. Instead, you could end up locked into a plane plunging towards the ground, too focused on your instruments to consider ejecting.

It's worth emphasizing just how bad it is to miss out on opportunities you could've otherwise taken. These opportunities could be new friendships, romantic relationships, workshops, or an interview practice set up by the CCO. They could be professors you could've emailed looking for research positions, conversations with them you could've had, books you could've read, projects you could've done. The Robot cannot reprioritize; it can do a lot of work, but it will waste most of its energy on suboptimal uses of time.

Leaving just an hour a week free to relax for a bit (but without stimulation, no distractions), poke around emailing professors, checking calendars for events, reviewing the day's work, scheduling tomorrow, keeping an eye out for opportunities you haven't noticed, and overall considering your life. It will do more for you than you could imagine. Better yet, set this time up as "miscellaneous task" time. If you can do it in less than 5 minutes, do it during miscellaneous task time. If you can't, spend a minute scheduling a time to get it done. Also, use this time to check in with yourself. Do you feel stressed? Is the world closing in around you? If you feel an unbearable temptation to work, feel as though the world will end if you spare this hour, you may be well on your way to task saturation.

With proper situational awareness, you'll be able to aggressively steal every potentially useful tactic, bit of advice, and slightly useful study method from everyone near you. Remember to constantly keep an eye out for ways to do what you're already doing faster, easier, or better. Look for unexpected opportunities, new relationships, and interesting events. You should aim to be a combination of all the smartest people around you, years of other people's wisdom distilled into a set of techniques that ensure you can do more, learn faster, and have more fun.

Keep your eyes open and your head up. Maintain situational awareness, spot problems or spikes of work that are on the horizon. Make sure you don't have scheduling conflicts, you're not forgetting anything, and you've responded to your grandma's texts. Keep an eye out for opportunities that are more rewarding than what you're currently doing. That can be anything from a TA opportunity to a club orientation having extra pizza (I took two full pizzas back to my dorm :>). Make sure your smaller goals haven't gone bad and that your larger goals are making you happy. Spending a few minutes a day evaluating how you've been doing can save you months or years of wasted effort across your life.
### Improve Yourself
Dedicate some time to improving your decision-making, goal-defining, habit-creating, or prioritizing skills. I recommend:
- Ultralearning
- Algorithms to Live By
- The Art of Clear Thinking
- Atomic Habits

Don't just read them, study them. Use the conceptual studying strategy I mentioned later on, then use them to make actionable changes in your life. If you've read a book halfway and are unable to name one thing you're going to do differently, then stop reading; it's not helping. Ideally, you should be able to reference them when trying to set up a habit, learn something quickly, or make a good decision. This is akin to learning to read a map; incredibly useful, but not in isolation, don't use it as a pure replacement for work. Don't take them as gospel; some things will work for you, some things won't.

Evaluate your past decisions, actions, behavior, and performance. When you fail, thinking about it can feel like trying to stare into the sun. You'll want to turn away, pretend like it never happened, but in doing so, you'll never learn. Failing is rarely good, but once you've failed, you have the opportunity to learn; don't give that opportunity up. Build a habit of constructively criticizing yourself, but don't let it turn into anxiety or self-loathing. You shouldn't ruminate negatively for long periods of time; all critiques should be focused either on identifying a problem or solving it, not torturing yourself. 

Sometimes you might need to give yourself space from your failure until you're ready to look at it logically. I recommend writing post-mortems on why you failed, the specific actions you took that led up to it, how you feel afterwards, and what a world in which you succeeded would've looked like. Note your flaws, be aware of them, and plan around them.

Don't put pressure on yourself to immediately fix everything. You're a work in progress, as is everyone. Fixing your flaws is one of many ways you could spend your energy, and if better uses of time exist, then they can be left alone. 

Be careful about rationalizing yourself out of confronting your flaws, especially if they're hurting others. But it's okay to admit that you spend a bit too much time on your phone, or should be more active, without immediately devoting your life to the gym. Try for slow, gradual improvement. If you have the time or energy, it can be worth it to aggressively attempt to fix a flaw (eg, going to the gym 6 times a week, quitting nicotine cold turkey), but I find it best to just keep things moving, however slowly, in the right direction. Eat a bit better, exercise a bit more, be a little bit more patient. Keep track of your progress, if you can. Like I said, data works wonders. Get feedback, then use that feedback to improve.
#### Beneficial Habits
Avoid [short-form content](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10756502/). Some is fine, but if you're spending longer than 30 uninterrupted minutes looking at TikTok or Instagram reels, that's a bad sign. It's a habit that doesn't teach you anything and rarely engenders anything like happiness or satisfaction. Instead, it leads to numbness. Use it to connect with friends and send funny videos, but do not use it as a replacement for a hobby or a personality.

Develop hobbies that produce something. Writing, LEGO, programming, art, cooking, amateur rocketry, pottery, or gardening. Don't try to develop the most impressive and erudite hobby. Just try to find something you enjoy doing. Not only will this help with self-actualization, but it also improves your ability to focus on projects long-term, trains you to seek happiness through production (rather than consumption or escapism), and can often be a great topic of conversation.

Try to make reading and writing hobbies, if you can. It doesn't much matter what you read (so long as it is long-form content), only that you do. Both habits encourage long-term focus, clarity of mind, and strengthen your inner monologue. Even if you read only the lowest of BookTok trash and write nothing but Scooby-Doo self-insert fanfics, you'll still end up a better communicator, more able to explain yourself in all manner of situations.

Fitness is important. Exercise improves cognitive function in both the short and long term, increases your confidence, decreases mortality, lets you move really heavy boxes, improves your mental health,  leads to better sleep, and gives you more energy. Figure out some form of exercise that you enjoy (or at least can stand) and try to do it regularly. It might take some time to get into it, and you'll feel awkward as you stumble through a workout you've not done before. But try it a few times, once you get into a rhythm, it can start feeling great. Consistency is the most important thing; pick something you can fit into your schedule.

While it's good to focus on the life you'd like to have, I recommend also thinking about the person you'd like to be. What virtues do you want to embody: kindness, conscientiousness, honesty? What principles do you want to have? What are you willing to sacrifice to be a good person? I don't expect the average person to put their life on the line for their principles, but I know people who've been unwilling to support a friend who'd been deeply hurt because it'd "cause a fuss". If your principles cannot withstand a mildly uncomfortable confrontation, then they're not principles. Plus, when you stand by your principles, you'll get an absolutely intoxicating sensation of moral superiority, and that? That's priceless.
# An Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass
## This Is It. This Is All There Is.
"I'd like to have a girlfriend, but I just don't see how I'd be able to spend any time with her" - Anonymous friend with a 4.0 GPA.

It's a good idea to grind, to focus on the future, to build a better life for yourself. But don't wait to start living. Your goal isn't to be the best or to get the best job; it's to have the best life you can, and you're already living life. This is it. This is all there is. If you don't start living now, you might never start at all. If you haven't noticed, I'm trying _really hard_ to sell you on the fact that there's more to college than just academics.

Free time is not a sin, especially not if you spend it doing things you genuinely enjoy. Brainrotting on TikTok for 14 hours and skipping all your classes is a terrible idea, but forming relationships, doing fun things, and actually conversing with a member of the opposite sex (or same sex, I don't judge) aren't wastes of time if you genuinely value them. Don't put off living; don't feel guilt for living. You need balance if you're going to make it through four years here.

But on the other hand, make sure that you're actually doing things you value. It's all too easy to fall into the habit of just doing the easiest, lowest-energy activity available (Instagram Reels has taken much of my life). If you need some time to rest and relax, then you should relax, but try to do more memorable and unique things. If you can't remember what you did in your free time yesterday, you probably didn't spend it very well. Optimizing your time use doesn't apply just to academics; put effort into spending your free time doing things you're proud of having done. That being said, here's a brief **Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass at Purdue**.

### Friends
The first few weeks are critical. You're going to arrive on campus and for a brief, beautiful window _nobody will have friends_. Which means everyone _wants friends_, which means everyone is going to be really, really open to talking to (and hanging out with) new people. This only lasts a little bit. Once people have found their friend groups (and once you've found yours), they're going to spend a lot less time talking to strangers and a lot more time talking to their friends.

That means you have a limited amount of time to get into at least one friend group before the whole thing becomes a lot more difficult. So spend the first week or two meeting absolutely everyone you can. Say hi, play a board game, join a group for lunch. If you don't like your BGR group, join another one. Even if you're a weird little gremlin who everyone hates, if you play the numbers game enough, you're almost certain to find a group of people who at least tolerate you. You shouldn't just hang out with the same two people you knew from high school. Push past that social anxiety, remember that those strangers are just as afraid of you as you are of them!

Because classes are nonexistent and everyone is desperate to find someone to hang out with, you're going to have lots of opportunities to make and maintain friendships. But you can't stay friends with everyone. As classes get harder, people will begin to withdraw. They'll stop hanging out with as many people and retreat to a smaller circle. This is when the core of your friend group will form. Try to keep everyone as an acquaintance (if even a distant one), but pick the best people you've met and put in the effort to keep hanging out with them, even while you're busy.

When choosing your closest friends, pick people who you'd like to become more similar to. If someone told you that you were a lot like your friends, and that made you feel happy, then you're probably in good company. 

Don't just hang out with the first person to tolerate your presence; find people with whom you really vibe. Also, if you have smart friends, they'll help you in classes. CS-381 is far more fun with friends.

#### Talking to Strangers
1. They will not remember you unless you screw up monumentally. Like, vomit in front of them or something. People do not have enough mental bandwidth to judge strangers.
2. Use something you have in common. If they're strangers, then use something visible on their person ("oh wow is that a ___ shirt?") or something in your current environment ("Does the line always get this long?"). If they brush you off, don't force it, don't try again, just move on.
3. Don't monologue. Most people like to talk, let them. If they're talking a lot, chances are they're enjoying the conversation. Or maybe you got a fact wrong and they're correcting you. Either way, they're engaged!
4. Don't aggressively steer conversations to your special interests. If they're interested, they'll bite. If they steer the conversation away, they don't want to hear about Sonic the Hedgehog.
5. Continuation of #2, try to build off shared emotions, like you both bombing an exam. In fact, right after an exam is a great time to chat.
6. Don't try to awkwardly join discussions between friends. If you're a gregarious enough person, you might be able to pull it off, but let's be honest, you're a Purdue CS student.

#### Making People You Talk To Friends
1. Ideally, meet the same people multiple times. If you see them a lot, it makes the following steps easier.
2. Walk with them wherever they're going (as long as it's the direction you're headed, or not too far out of your way). **Do not follow people if they don't want you there, don't be creepy**.
3. Try to meet outside of class or whatever environment you see them in. This can be as blunt as asking someone you've just met to help you study, or asking the person you're walking with if they want to get lunch together.
4. Try to make a routine. It's difficult to keep asking someone to hang out. It's much easier if you know you're both going to meet on Friday to study, because that's what you do every Friday.
5. Be classy about rejection. If someone keeps having excuses for not hanging with you, just say, "Sucks that you're so busy. Let me know when you're free," and move on.
### Roommate(s)
Ideally, with the advice above, you'll have found a group of friends. From there, you need to pick a roommate, and you'll need to do this earlier in the year than you'd think. If you plan on living off campus (try to sign a lease by October), you'll be sharing a kitchen and a lease with them. If you're on campus, then you'll be sharing a room. This can either lead to an uncomfortable cold war with what used to be a friend, or the solidification of your already rock-solid friendship bond into a friendship diamond that can transcend any mortal struggle.

Your roommate should also be someone you respect and like a great deal. You should want to be more like them, because after a year in the same room, you'll start to mind-meld. If your roommate is a workaholic, seeing them do work will encourage you. If they're a socialite, they'll help get you out of the dorm. If they're smart, they can help with classes. If they're an alcoholic... well...

A few red flags that are fine in friends but bad in roommates:
1. Never leaves the room. It means they'll never leave _your_ room. If that's a problem, pick someone who touches grass more.
2. Always has crazy stuff happen to them. If you're their friend, you get a front row seat. If you're their roommate, you might become involved in their drama.
3. Always in fights. They'll start fighting with you.
4. Crazy party animal. If they vomit, you might have to clean it up.
5. Snores.
6. Is a romantic interest. Don't, not until you've known them for longer than a few months.
7. Always has their romantic interest (or partner) two feet away. That romantic interest will be an honorary roommate.
8. Is someone who constantly needs help or is struggling. You're likely to get wrapped up in their problems.
9. Smells bad.

As a coincidence, these all apply to romantic partners, too.
### Romance
I'll keep this short, so I don't look like an idiot (as most people do when they give romantic advice).

You cannot make people like you. If someone doesn't seem to like you, move on. Don't follow them around, don't ask them out for the seventh time, don't harass them, don't complain about them. It doesn't matter if you feel like this is once-in-a-lifetime love; if they're not feeling it, there's not much you can do. Meeting lots of people is a far better strategy for finding someone who likes you than obsessing over your one female friend.

You cannot change people. If someone is a mess when you meet them, they're likely to stay a mess when you date them. If they're depressed when you meet them, they'll be depressed when you date them. Especially do not date people because you feel sorry for them, or because you think you can help them. If you want to help someone, it's best to do that as their friend, not as their partner.

Once you're in a relationship, things that work for some people won't work for others. Figure out what your partner likes (you can just ask them) and do that. If you're not sure how they're feeling about something, ask them. Do your best not to push them into anything they're uncomfortable with, and avoid moving the relationship quicker than they'd like. For some people, a proposal six months into a relationship is amazing; for others, it's a nightmare. It all depends on your partner.

Don't date the first person you lay eyes on in BGR.
# The Academics
### My Study Methods
Classes often contain three things you need to study:
1. Procedural knowledge. How to do something. Like math.
2. Conceptual knowledge. What something is, does, or how it works. Like history.
3. Factual knowledge. Dates, names, numbers, definitions. Also like history.

All of calculus is procedural knowledge. Linear Algebra is procedural and a bit conceptual. CS-180 has changed since I took it, but it's mostly procedural with some factual mixed in. CS-240, CS-250, and CS-252 were a mixture of procedural, conceptual, and factual. CS-251 and CS-182 were procedural. If a class's exams involve doing some task with an objective right or wrong (FRQ coding, solving math problems), they're probably procedural. If they involve answering questions with multiple sentences or applying knowledge, they're conceptual. If they're multiple choice (excluding math), fill-in-the-blank, or require remembering specific numbers or words in association with something, they're factual.

Study procedural knowledge by performing the procedures you'll be tested on as often as possible, in as similar an environment to the test as possible. That means do study guides, write practice code problems for 240, 250, and 252, and do them repeatedly. Grade your work; if you did it wrong, redo it correctly. Most students will come in with only a conceptual, theoretical understanding. Practicing the procedure will make you far faster and much more correct.

Study conceptual knowledge by picking topics and trying to write your entire understanding of them down as quickly as possible. Don't use the internet or outside help. After you're done, use your resources to edit your initial writing to make it better. Learning about paging? Write everything you know about paging down on a sheet of paper (or an online document), then go to the slides to add all the facts you missed.

Study factual knowledge with flashcards. Go through the class's material and note everything that could be tested on. Put everything you can in a Quizlet or Knowt flashcard deck, then study. Don't study this way if you don't need to. If your first midterm didn't require you to memorize any specific definitions or numbers, it might be more worthwhile to focus on conceptual knowledge instead.

Use spaced repetition. Just because you have a good grasp of something now doesn't mean you'll still remember it for the test. The more times you review something, the more likely it is to stay in your brain.

Remember that classes can involve multiple different types of knowledge, and that you'll often be assessed on being able to complete a certain procedure (correctly answering test questions). While you may know everything about CS-252, it can be worthwhile to practice writing code in the style of the exam, on a piece of paper, with no IDE. This'll teach you to quickly answer handwritten coding questions, and while that skill isn't exactly what CS-252 is trying to teach you, it's very useful for getting a good grade in the class.

Do not mindlessly re-read notes except as a quick refresher before an exam. If you're not rephrasing it, remembering it, or learning it for the first time, you're probably not learning at all.
### Use TAs
I'm biased, obviously, but we do occasionally know what we're talking about. If you're stuck on something, you could spend three hours figuring it out. Or you could show up to office hours (or another lab session), ask a TA, and watch them solve it in five minutes.

Please at least attempt to solve it beforehand. Try to add print statements and give the TAs information about what you've tried and what hasn't worked. It'll help us fix your issue far faster than if you just plop a computer down in front of us and go, "It doesn't work". TAs are essential in CS250 and CS252 (what a coincidence... the classes I TA).

Ask undergraduate TAs for advice in the class. They've taken the class before and did well enough that they were able to TA it. Some of them will have succeeded due to innate ability or more motivation, but they might also have some strategies that could help you out. Graduate TAs are a great source of advice if you want to go into grad school. If the lab is slow, don't be afraid to ask them about their research, their path to grad school, and their life advice. Remember that their priority is answering lab-related questions; don't bother them when they're busy!
### Academic Dishonesty
Most often, cheating is done out of desperation due to poor time management, which means it's done sloppily. Sloppy cheating is never the best use of your time; it is never optimal. It's more of a signal that you've got too much on your plate, or that you lack time management skills. Every semester, we tell people in CS-180 that they'll get caught if they copy-paste someone else's work. Every semester, a horde of idiots does just that. Rather than cheating, I recommend the tactics I mention in **Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)**.

When talking about the risks of cheating, most obviously, you could get caught. Purdue will not mess around, and you probably can't BS them once they're on to you. I know people who run academic integrity for the courses you'll probably be taking. It's difficult to tell who's using ChatGPT, but we've had decades of experience catching students who copy and paste. If you do cheat, there's an automatic 0 on the assignment (duh). You're also likely to get your overall letter grade lowered (eg, if you would have gotten an A, you get a B+ or a B) and could end up with your cheating recorded by the Office of the Dean of Students.

Another risk is that you don't learn the class content. That's not too bad if it's some random class you're taking to meet an arbitrary graduation requirement. That's disastrous if you're taking any of the following classes:
1. CS-180
2. CS-182
3. CS-240
4. CS-250
5. CS-251, if you plan on doing anything related to algorithms (eg, CS-381)
6. CS-252, if you plan on doing anything related to systems (eg, CS-354)
7. Calc 1 and Calc 2

Failing to understand the concepts presented in these classes will directly impact your performance in later classes. Even within a single class, failing to understand prerequisite material can result in needing to cheat later on to maintain your performance.

If you have a history of cheating in Calc-1 and then attempt to cheat your way through Calc-2 and get caught, you'll either have to risk further penalty by continuing to cheat or teach yourself all the concepts you missed in Calc-1 so you can complete the course authentically.

Never, ever cheat in CS-180. Not only do you run the risk of getting a permanent mark on your record for cheating in the easiest CS class in your easiest semester, but you run the risk of never learning core skills that you'll use for the rest of your degree (and career). 

If you cheat once or twice, that is a strong sign that you struggle with time management, motivation, or some other core competency, which almost guarantees your failure. Fix it before classes get harder. 

CS-180 is a course that teaches you to program by forcing you to do a lot of programming. It may feel fairly repetitive, but the repetition will increase your speed, decrease the quantity of bugs you produce, and make the entire rest of college easier. Not to mention your first semester is crucial to building good habits that'll stick with you for the rest of college. 

If you're seriously considering frequent cheating in CS-180, I'd advise dropping out or changing majors. The only scenario in which I could see that kind of cheating in CS-180 being a good idea is if those options weren't available to you (unsafe home environment and parents who would only pay for a CS degree, for example). 

Other than that, cheating in CS-180 is monumentally stupid. You're cheating during the tutorial. This is as easy as it gets. If you don't learn now, you'll have to learn later, in a far less forgiving course.

In general, I'd say it's okay to:
1. Check answers with friends.
2. Describe and clarify the requirements of a problem (eg, clarifying a bad handout or something).
3. Describe how you solved a problem in English.
4. Solve a problem/algorithm in English together, then go off and write your own code.

You start getting into cheating territory when you:
1. Edit someone else's code directly.
2. Tell someone the exact code you used.
3. Copy-paste. Don't copy-paste. You'll get caught, and it's stupid. Don't.
### Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)
You don't need to learn everything in every class at college. Most of the classes are pretty useful; that communications class is probably going to be pretty valuable in your future. But oftentimes, random gen-eds and classes in areas that don't interest you are going to be chock full of stuff you don't care about. In those courses, your goal should be to get a good grade with minimal effort.

If you aren't interested in a course, try to see if you can get away with not taking it. Use CLEP credits, a test-out, or try to swap the class with a class you're interested in.

If that doesn't work, try to see if there are online variants of the class, easier professors, or professors who are known for not taking attendance. 

Now it's worth clarifying that you are human, and your judgment is flawed. You could catastrophically misjudge a course (or its difficulty), decide that some topic is useless before realizing it's going to keep cropping up over and over again (cough concurrency cough), or fail to understand how a course might not help your academic understanding of computer science, but could be pretty useful in a job or your personal life. Putting minimal effort in comes with risks (especially when done with CS courses), make sure those risks are worth it.

If you want to understand the topics in a course:
1. Follow along with it as it's taught; don't learn the concepts right before the exam.
2. Attend class.
3. Review what you learned in class afterwards.
4. Review frequently, even if only for a small amount of time.
5. Rephrase the knowledge, try to distill key concepts, write out everything you know about the subject, and talk about it to your friends.

If you want to get a good grade in a course (with minimal time investment):
1. Skip classes if you can learn on your own faster.
2. Do as much homework as early as possible in the semester so it's out of the way.
3. Ignore class content until you get near an exam, then cram for the exam.

This is very, very risky. Until you're used to college, it's not worth it to skip every class and learn content right before the exam. In fact, for many people, that won't work at all. Additionally, like I said, our judgment is flawed. Especially when we're new to college. Attempting extreme time-saving measures early on in college can hurt your grades or prevent you from learning things you really should've learned.

I'd recommend starting slow, slowly reducing your effort in courses you don't need much understanding in. If you're still getting good grades and doing well on exams, feel free to dial back the effort even more. 

This comes with the inherent risk of a dark horse final appearing out of nowhere that's far more difficult than the rest of the course. But running the risk of getting a B in a course you don't care about can be worthwhile if it means getting an A in a course you do care about, or if you're doing more valuable things with your time. Understand that this comes with risk, and should be done **carefully**, **slowly**, and ideally _very little or not at all in your first semester_.

STAT-511 was, to me, a course I didn't care much about. The concepts were easy enough to review on their own, most of which I'd already learned in AP Stats. I'd show up to class (attendance was required), put my earbuds in, and do other work. I'd blitz through the homework, looking to complete it with minimal effort, then right before the exam, I studied a ton. I got a 100%. 

Then I studied the same for the final, which ended up being an entirely different format from the first exam. My overall grade in this fairly easy course was reduced to a B+. If I'd had a better understanding of the course, I could've gotten an A.

In a perfect world, we could invest a ton of effort into every class we took, but at Purdue, you're going to be busy. If you're forced to make time or are fighting with a stuffed schedule, putting less effort into classes that you deem less important can be a good idea.

Keep in mind that this "ignore then cram" strategy is uniquely well-suited to me; I'm very good at teaching myself. It might be (probably is) terrible for you. Be very, very careful when using it; never use it in a class you can't easily retake.
### White Whales
White Whales are classes that are fairly easy to get a B or C in, but require an extreme amount of effort to get an A. Perfectionists will often tank their mental health, putting all their other graders (and activities) at risk, to chase a White Whale. This is a particularly bad idea if the course is one you're not interested in, passionate about, or suited for.

If you think it's achievable, then feel free to hunt that White Whale. But remember that your effort should be used in the most efficient manner possible. If your mental health is destroyed, you couldn't dedicate any time to your friends, job search, hobbies, or personal projects, and you run the risk of your grades slipping in other classes; that A isn't worth it. 

I'm a bit of a perfectionist (when it comes to courses I care about). Sometimes that motivation can be great. But other times it makes me ignore things that would be better uses of my time in favor of chasing an A that doesn't matter. Ask yourself if you can spend the time you'd use to get an A on something that might be more rewarding.

It's also worth noting that you could be dumping a lot of effort into a strategy that's just not working. What might at first seem to be a white whale could be an easy A once you learn how to study for it. I took a history course that graded us on in-class essays. I could easily get Bs on the essays, but it was a struggle to get anywhere near As. I studied and memorized a huge amount, and my grades climbed into the B+ range. But I was putting more effort into this history class than most of my CS classes. Then I figured out (stole) a better studying method, writing practice essays. Suddenly, with less effort, I was getting As (and remembering more class content).
### Beware the Rogue Wave
No individual class is all that hard. They're not designed to be hard; they're designed to teach you things. That sometimes means lots of work, or some difficult exams, but classes are scheduled so that they're not overwhelming. 

The real problem is that you don't just have one class, you've got five. While a single class will attempt to distribute its work evenly so as not to overwhelm students, multiple classes can and _absolutely will_ synchronize midterms, projects, or homeworks to all be due at once.

I once had an incredibly easy semester, except for when every single one of my classes had a midterm over the space of 6 days. Just like how waves can combine to create massive rogue waves, your classes will combine to create rogue waves of work that will sweep you away unless you spot them ahead of time. Remember that your workload can vary wildly. If there's a rogue wave on the horizon and you're already struggling to keep up, it might be worthwhile to shed responsibility.

Part of the reason it's so important to leave yourself some wiggle room is that workloads will vary massively, and in ways you can't predict. Some semesters will be easy, but will have sudden and extreme spikes in work (see my example with the 6-day midterm hell). Others will be full of difficult classes, but will spread the work out so you'll find yourself with a shockingly manageable semester.

Read the syllabus, make sure you're aware of when midterms will happen, and try to lessen their impact.
## The Job Hunt
While academics dominate the minds of students, the hunt for internships (and jobs) is what's important. Not so much your freshman year (though you should turn up to a few career fairs to get used to it), but sophomore year and up your internships can matter as much as (or more than) your grades.

Despite this, students tend to massively underinvest in finding an internship. This makes it comparatively easy to stand out in the job search (far easier than standing out in terms of GPA). 

Additionally, putting extra effort into job hunting tends to be low commitment, without many quitting costs. Nobody's going to care if you decide that you can't show up at a career fair or don't have time to tune your resume.

If you were willing to get Bs in a few hard classes instead of As (or Cs instead of Bs), it might lower your GPA by 0.1 or 0.2. Dedicating that time to aggressively hunting for jobs, tuning up your resume, getting a professional headshot taken, and practicing interview skills can set you apart from the crowd.

In your freshman year, spend time asking people at career fairs what they look for on resumes, getting advice from upperclassmen, and making use of the many Purdue resources to help you get a job. Practice mock interviews, learn STAR questions, and you'll do great.
### Career Fairs
A few hours at a career fair can save you dozens of hours applying to online positions. Go to booths that have people actively interviewing, not just advertising. If they have iPads, take resumes, or have some software component where you register your attendance at the career fair, those are the most valuable booths. If not, there's a chance you'll just be told to apply online, and nothing you said to the recruiter will impact your chances of an offer.

Do research beforehand, and create a list of companies you want to talk to. Check that they accept people of your class level. Prioritize those that seem to be doing interviews (as mentioned), Google them in-depth while you're in line. Come off as curious, open to learn, but knowledgeable. Don't try to outsmart the recruiter; be friendly, emphasize passion, experience, and anything unique that helps you stand out.

I've found that "talking shop" with a recruiter (discussing both of your experiences in technical projects, classes, etc) tends to be a great way to get them to like you. Bring up your relevant experiences whenever possible.
### Resume
Spend time on your resume. For a few hours of investment, you can see massive improvements in the kinds of opportunities you'll get and how successful you are at applying. I don't know how to write a good resume, but other people do; you should seek their feedback constantly.

There are resume workshops, Purdue-sponsored resume tools, and plenty more to help you tune up your resume. Don't treat your resume as a hobby or your last priority; put real effort into it.
### Applying Online
Cover letters should be short, if you write them at all. They should be of the format "Hey, I'm __ from Purdue University, I think my skills in X and Y, and my project Z would make me a good fit for this position." Don't use ChatGPT, don't glaze the company, just explain why you're a good fit for that position.

Apply early, apply to far more companies than you think you should. Aim for over 100 applications. Start applying almost as soon as school starts. This is less relevant in your freshman year. If you want a freshman internship, consider having rich parents with valuable industry connections.

Feel free to use tools that will automate filling out Workday forms. I used Simplicity, but it ran into some issues. I'm going to try to build an automated tool that'll rapidly fill out applications. I'll link it here if/when I finish it.
### A Short Note
Frankly, I was pretty bad at hunting for jobs. Seek advice from recruiters, your interviewers, upperclassmen, and people working in the CCO. I didn't put much effort into hunting for a job two years ago, and last year I stumbled into an opportunity so quickly that I didn't have much time to learn the ins and outs of job hunting.

The advice of other people would be much appreciated. If you've had success, what helped you? What was a standout on your resume that didn't take much time to do? What kind of things are people sleeping on? What should they do more of?
### Doing the Job
If you've got an internship, you should treat it as a combination behavioral interview and learning opportunity. You've already gotten the internship, so they're likely confident in your technical skills. Your return offer will rely on your ability to cooperate with others, communicate, and produce quality work.
#### Ask the Right Kinds of Questions
What are the right kinds of questions? They're questions that can't be answered on your own and rely on the experience of your boss. Don't ask questions you can Google, don't ask questions that are answered in the onboarding resources you've been given. 

Feel more than free to ask questions to clarify your boss's instructions, get their help on a problem, get advice about the corporate world (or about life), or double-check something important that you're unsure about.

Many people make the mistake of treating an internship like they're interviewing. That's sort of correct, but remember that internships are more about cultural fit than technical competency. It's okay (expected even) to admit you don't know something, but it's very annoying to pretend that you do, then fail. Don't pretend you know things that you don't.

If you _do_ pretend you know things that you don't, then absolutely don't keep pretending even after it's obvious you're clueless. Do not double down; your boss can tell when you're doubling down on your ignorance, and it frustrates them. It also makes it less likely they'll take time out of their day to explain things to you, because explaining things to someone who refuses to admit they're lost is incredibly frustrating.
#### Do Your Work
Self-explanatory, yet difficult for some people to grasp.
#### Yes, That Means You Should Be Doing Your Work, Not AI
If AI can do your job, you won't have it for long. Chances are, if an AI can do your entire job
1. The internship is a simplified version of the real job, one meant to teach you skills that you're not learning because you're using ChatGPT.
2. You're doing your job poorly, but don't realize it, because you're just using an AI.
#### Know the Warning Signs
The corporate world tends to be incredibly sanitized. When you screw up (especially as an intern), people won't get mad at you, they won't yell at you, they might not even say "you screwed up". They will smile at you because that's their job, then they will tell the people making hiring decisions that you're a terrible fit.

Some red flags are:
- People start doing work that was once assigned to you, even though you're not busy.
- Your manager has a habit of sighing really hard in meetings when you present your work.
- People often need to redo the work you've done. They don't just offer feedback; they make you step-by-step change it in front of them, or they take it from you and fix it.
- In meetings, people say things like "why don't we discuss the disconnect" or "this really needs to get done"
- You're micromanaged significantly more than the other interns

Remember, the corporate world is very, very nice (at least at the surface level). If people say "oh, we do X here," that's not a fun fact; they're telling you to do X. If they tell you "oh, we don't generally do Y," they're telling you not to do Y. If they say "you shouldn't" or "try not to," that's not a request, that's an order. Better to be over-sensitive to this stuff than to miss it and piss people off.
#### Network
Go out of your way to talk to a bunch of people. You're like the office kids; everyone likes it when you come around to visit. Try not to overdo it, though, and be respectful of busy people's time. You should only have friendly/introductory meetings once; if you meet again, it should be because they offered, or you have a work-related question for them.

If you schedule a friendly meeting with someone, mention why you're interested in them specifically, something from their background that sets them apart, or your interest in the position they occupy. Oftentimes, you can leave a positive impression (and pick up some wisdom) by just asking a few questions and letting people monologue.

Also, try to remember the names of the people you run into day-to-day. This can be as simple as dedicating 15 minutes to studying a list of them that you've written down.
## Conclusion
I'd like to think I'm a good writer, and good writing can fool you into thinking what I say is more official, more authoritative, or more trustworthy than it actually is. Perhaps if I add additional perspectives to this document, get validation from professors and advisors, and revise this document two or three (hundred) times, it'll become trustworthy. As of now, you should treat this as a particularly long comment on social media.

This document, long as it is, represents only one perspective. I did my best to communicate the most valuable things I've learned, but I am just one person. 

This isn't a bible; it shouldn't be treated as such. It should be treated as one piece of advice, from one person, that you may use as you wish. Gather additional advice from your academic advisor, your peers, your upperclassmen, your professors, and random strangers on Reddit when you inevitably post something like "How hard is CS240?".  

The most important things I've mentioned are:
- Figure out what you want out of life, and take steps to achieve that.
- Try a lot, then pare down your responsibilities until you can manage it.
- Keep an eye out for new opportunities.
- Put effort into becoming a good person.
- Don't wait to start living, enjoy college.
- Be incredibly chatty in your first few weeks here.
- Spend more time than you think you should hunting for jobs.
- When you've got a job, remember that people will be very nice to you, but that doesn't mean they're not upset at you.

The absolute most important takeaway is to never stop learning, growing, and improving. Don't get stuck in your ways; keep looking for ways to do better.
#### Feedback
If you've spotted anything that looks like bad advice, please tell me so I can fix it. The same goes for grammatical errors. The first draft I threw in Grammarly had over 600; I'm used to them. If you've got advice to give, leave it below. I'll do my best to credit you. Reading through this whole thing isn't easy, and I respect the commitment to get to the end. Because of that, your comments, critiques, or additional advice to add is incredibly valuable. I'll try to respond to all of it.
